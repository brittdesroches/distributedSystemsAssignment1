How to use the program:
  - Compile Server and Client

  - Start server with "java ConversionServer 3500"
    (3500 is an example port number)

  - Start Client with "java ConversionClient 3500 localhost"
    (3500 as the same as the server example port number, localhost as the generic host name)

  - On the client, input the arguments or type 'help' for assistance at any time.
    Arguments are entered as follows: 'currentType' 'newType' 'number', where currentType is the number system
      of the number value and the newType is the type you want it converted to.
  
  - Currently, the only options for currentType and newType are binary or decimal.

  - To disconnect from the server, enter the command 'exit'
